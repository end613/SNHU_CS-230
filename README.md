Operating Systems And Platforms


I documented the software architecture by studying platform compatibility and evaluating server/client-side tools and making sure all user and game requirements were clearly addressed. I also integrated feedback from each project phase to evolve the design into a production-ready state.


The design document creation process before coding allowed us to understand how user requirements match up with software limitations. The document established a clear direction which improved both upcoming development work and communication with potential stakeholders.


If I were to revise this work, I would enhance the visual elements, such as diagrams and user flows, to better illustrate system interactions. I would also expand the development tools section to further highlight cross-platform development strategies.


I focused on understanding both the functional and non-functional requirements—such as platform independence, scalability, and security—to ensure the software meets user expectations. User needs were central in decisions like selecting Java (due to its platform independence) and Linux (for stability and cost-efficiency).


The project required me to use layered architecture analysis together with platform compatibility mapping and system modeling which included UML diagrams. The design incorporated software engineering principles and OOP principles to achieve modularity and maintainability and scalability.
